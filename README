A simple animation program that automatically generates in betweens for hand drawn key frames.

MVP:
- user can draw on screen using mouse
- keyboard bindings to make new frame (N), move between frames (arrows), animate (enter)
- animation displays the in between frames for all the hand drawn key frames

Extras:
- erasing lines
- deleting frames
- multiple lines on one frame
- support saving/loading files
- support exporting as a gif
- buttons in addition to key bindings
- allow user to set the num frames between keyframes
- show the betweens in drawing mode, allow the user to edit them (convert to keyframe)

Model:
- cache inbetweens?
- an Animation contains a List[Frame]
- to cache in betweens, Animation could have a Dict[int (key), List[Frame] (betweens) ]
    - everytime a frame is changed, the betweens before and after it have to be wiped
- a Frame contains a line or a list of lines
    - should be read only outside the model - how to ensure this? wrapper?
- lines represented as a List[Pixel]
- methods:
    - frameAt(idx), keyFrameAt(keyIdx), addFrameAt(keyIdx), addPixToFrame(keyIdx, posn), newLine(keyIdx)
    - numFrames(), numKeyFrames()

View:
- separate views for the drawing part of the window: one that animates, one that draws
    - possibly more if we add ability to show betweens in drawing mode
- textual view to render to file
- methods: render, animate (is this in place of render?), setKeyVisible?
- pressing arrows to navigate between frames is internal
- notify controller for: drawing on a frame, playing animation, adding a frame

Controller:
- methods: startLineOn(idx), addPix(idx, x, y), newFrame(),
