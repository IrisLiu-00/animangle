#Animangle!

A simple animation program that generates in betweens for hand drawn frames.

Written in Python and tkinter using the MVC architecture - I wrote
this mostly as a short exercise in learning Python and figuring
out how to use MVC with a new language. 

##To run the program

src/Animangle.py is the entry point of the program. Animations are
saved in text form as .animangle files.

The "n" key creates a new frame, while you can navigate between
frames with left and right arrows. The enter key starts the 
animation, while the spacebar returns back to drawing mode. 

##Potential future plans

Things I want to add to the application in the future.

- Figure out how to embed this as a webapp? 
- Add support for saving as gifs
- Deleting frames and lines
- Show the in betweens in drawing mode, and allow the user to
edit them (convert in betweens to key frames)
